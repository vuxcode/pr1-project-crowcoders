## Week 13 (Week 0 in terms of 10 week project-timeline)
**Monday, 2025-03-24**
  13.00-15.00: (Programming) Worked for a total of ca 2 hours.
  - Created the basic prototype (1 button click = win the game).
  - Tried some variations with changing buttons, button types and changing button color. Trying out some CSS-based changes. Lots of time spent staring at code examples and trying to figure out what's what.
    
**Tuesday, 2025-03-25**
  - 10.00: (Programming) Uploaded the prototype file(s) to GitHub since I forgot to do so yesterday.
  - 13.00: (Webdev) Did some more research/inspiration searching regarding the layout for the main webpage. Looked at different color schemes, haven't decided on one yet though.

  **Wednesday, 2025-03-26**
  - 08.30 - 10.00(?): (Programming) Further research into buttons and functions. Realized the original idea (Lights Out) might be a little too complicated for me. Considering changing idea to making a TicTacToe game instead, since there are more resources readily 
  available for that type of game.
  - 12.30 - 13.00: Attended workshop to discuss w/ teacher. Got the OK to change idea if I wanted to.
  - 16.00: (Programming) Might've had an Eureka moment. Will continue with Lights Out for now. Need to do more reading on loops and jQuery.

  **Thursday, 2025-03-27**
  - 10.00 - 13.00: (Both) Had another go at creating something basic with things I'm more confident in (CSS). Got a basic game board and CSS going.
  - 13.00 - 1400: (Both) Uploaded new commit to *index.html* with a basic template that I'll keep working with. (EDIT: I'll work on the Website and the Game in separate files and later on merge them into the main *index.html*).
  
## Week 14 (Week 1 in terms of 10 week project-timeline)
**Week summary, Monday - Friday, 31/3 - 4/4**

Became ill, and did not spend any major time on the FInal Project. Created new Project Files (*We1-Website.html* & *Pr1-Program.html*), where I intend to code the website and the Game. I still attended lessons online and did code-along. 

## Week 15 (Week 2 in the Project Timeline)
**Wednesday, 2025-04-09**
