## Week 13 (Week 0 in terms of 10 week project-timeline)
**Monday, 2025-03-24**
  - 13.00-15.00: (Programming) Worked for a total of ca 2 hours.
  - Created the basic prototype (1 button click = win the game).
  - Tried some variations with changing buttons, button types and changing button color. Trying out some CSS-based changes. Lots of time spent staring at code examples and trying to figure out what's what.
    
**Tuesday, 2025-03-25**
  - 10.00: (Programming) Uploaded the prototype file(s) to GitHub since I forgot to do so yesterday.
  - 13.00: (Webdev) Did some more research/inspiration searching regarding the layout for the main webpage. Looked at different color schemes, haven't decided on one yet though.

  **Wednesday, 2025-03-26**
  - 08.30 - 10.00(?): (Programming) Further research into buttons and functions. Realized the original idea (Lights Out) might be a little too complicated for me. Considering changing idea to making a TicTacToe game instead, since there are more resources readily 
  available for that type of game.
  - 12.30 - 13.00: Attended workshop to discuss w/ teacher. Got the OK to change idea if I wanted to.
  - 16.00: (Programming) Might've had an Eureka moment. Will continue with Lights Out for now. Need to do more reading on loops and jQuery.

  **Thursday, 2025-03-27**
  - 10.00 - 13.00: (Both) Had another go at creating something basic with things I'm more confident in (CSS). Got a basic game board and CSS going.
  - 13.00 - 1400: (Both) Uploaded new commit to *index.html* with a basic template that I'll keep working with. (EDIT: I'll work on the Website and the Game in separate files and later on merge them into the main *index.html*).
  
## Week 14 (Week 1 in terms of 10 week project-timeline)
**Week summary, Monday - Friday, 31/3 - 4/4**

Became ill, and did not spend any major time on the Final Project. Created new Project Files (*We1-Website.html* & *Pr1-Program.html*), where I intend to code the website and the Game. I still attended lessons online and did code-along. 

## Week 15 (Week 2 in the Project Timeline)
**Wednesday, 2025-04-09**
- (~1 hr? total). Still a bit sick, but continued researching and doing other smaller tasks: (Both) Uplaoded the main working files mentioned above. Did some more research into code structures and found some CSS to try out. Tried using loops to create a row of divs with mixed results.

**Friday, 2025-04-11**
- 10.00(??) - 13.30: (Webdev) Wrote basic HTML and CSS for the website. Mapped out rough placement of core features and visuals I want the page to have.

## Week 16 (Week 3 in the Project Timeline)
**Tuesday, 2025-04-15**
- (~2,5 hrs. Programming). Still trying to figure out how to generate the game board. Followed some online examples of generating a rhombus and then editing that code to try and make a hexagonal shape. Managed to get a more concrete way to structure the code (how I should think about it). Just have to actually make the steps work :]
- (~1,5 hrs. Programming). Took me 84 years, but got the game board shape I wanted (hexagon). Other problems arose that I will look into at in the future, mainly spacing and aesthetics.
**Wednesday, 2025-04-16**
- (~15 min. Webdev). Added placeholder buttons and code for future logo & favicon.
  
## Week 17 (Week 4 in the Project Timeline)
**Tuesday, 2025-04-22**
- (~45 min. Programming). Added CSS classes for the tile-states, attempted functions for interactivity (unsuccessfully). Tried toubleshooting on my own with the help of the course site and Google (still unsuccessfully). Might also have to look over naming conventions.
- (~30 min. Webdev). Tested out some dummy text, broke the main layout. Tried some quickfixes (relative position, margin). Did not fix it, will have to come back to it. Had fun with gradients instead.
  
**Wednesday, 2025-04-23**
- (5 min. Webdev). Fixed the dummy text layout (it was a simple div-width issue but my brain wasn't braining yesterday).
- (10 min. Programming). Researched some code, realized I'm trying to use syntax (ex. $())from JS libraries and not "pure" JS. Explains why things don't work as expected. (2 min later:) NVM it can also be used as a shortcut for a document function in JS.
