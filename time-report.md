  13.00-15.00: (Programming) Worked for a total of ca 2 hours.
  - Created the basic prototype (1 button click = win the game).
  - Tried some variations with changing buttons, button types and changing button color. Trying out some CSS-based changes. Lots of time spent staring at code examples and trying to figure out what's what.
    
**Tuesday, 2025-03-25**
  - 10.00: (Programming) Uploaded the prototype file(s) to GitHub since I forgot to do so yesterday.
  - 13.00: (Webdev) Did some more research/inspiration searching regarding the layout for the main webpage. Looked at different color schemes, haven't decided on one yet though.
